This is witeuro1 fortnite builds for u
NO im not trying to do soming bad and connect to epic games servers neonite is the backend for carbon

 you have to use carbon launcher only the reason why is because carbon lets you play up to versions old and new like the epic games launcher but fully allowed to play any verison of your choise
but all the verisons before 35.00 are below and you can play them and go in game.
the only downside is you cant open cheats but there is a way that you can get weapons but only the weapons in the verison like the hammerpump shotgun in version 28.40 as which.



YOU CAN PLAY CARBON WITH MY FORTNITE BUILDS AND FREELY PLAY NOW NO VIRUS OR NOTHING PLAY NOW!
